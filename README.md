John Hope
Assignment 5 - Unit, Mocking and Integration Testing

Overview:
    This program has 2 parts:
        - Amazon: 
        Contains an SQL database to store shopping cart data that is injected from the interface adaptor. It then can determine cost of the goods using determined rules in the 'Cost' folder.

        - Barnes:
        Barnes and Noble is simpler and stores book data in a seperate database. This includes 'book' object data,  price and amount.

    The goal of this assignment is to create mock tests to simulate the integration of detached parts.
